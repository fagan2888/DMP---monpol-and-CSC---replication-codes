	\paragraph{Syntax}

\begin{verbatim}
D = dbclip(D,Range)
\end{verbatim}

\paragraph{Input arguments}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \texttt{D} {[} struct {]} - Database or nested databases with tseries
  objects.
\item
  \texttt{Range} {[} numeric \textbar{} cell {]} - Range or a cell array
  of ranges to which all tseries objects will be clipped; multiple
  ranges can be specified, each for a different date
  frequency/periodicity.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Output arguments}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  \texttt{D} {[} struct {]} - Database with tseries objects cut down to
  \texttt{range}.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Description}

This functions looks up all tseries objects within the database
\texttt{d}, including tseries objects nested in sub-databases, and cuts
off any values preceding the start date of \texttt{Range} or following
the end date of \texttt{range}. The tseries object comments, if any, are
preserved in the new database.

If a tseries entry does not match the date frequency of the input range,
a warning is thrown.

Multiple ranges can be specified in \texttt{Range} (as a cell array),
each for a different date frequency/periodicity (i.e.~one or more of the
following: monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, yearly,
indeterminate). Each tseries entry will be clipped to the range that
matches its date frequency.

\paragraph{Example}

\begin{verbatim}
d = struct();
d.x = tseries(qq(2005,1):qq(2010,4),@rand);
d.y = tseries(qq(2005,1):qq(2010,4),@rand)

d =
   x: [24x1 tseries]
   y: [24x1 tseries]

dbclip(d,qq(2007,1):qq(2007,4))

ans =
    x: [4x1 tseries]
    y: [4x1 tseries]
\end{verbatim}
