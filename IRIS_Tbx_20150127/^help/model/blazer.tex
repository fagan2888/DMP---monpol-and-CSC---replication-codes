	\paragraph{Syntax}

\begin{verbatim}
[NameBlk,EqtnBlk] = blazer(M,...)
\end{verbatim}

\paragraph{Input arguments}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  \texttt{M} {[} model {]} - Model object.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Output arguments}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \texttt{M} {[} model {]} - Model object with variables and
  steady-state equations regrouped to create block-recursive structure.
\item
  \texttt{NameBlk} {[} cell {]} - Cell of cellstr with variable names in
  each block.
\item
  \texttt{EqtnBlk} {[} cell {]} - Cell of cellstr with equations in each
  block.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Description}

The reordering algorithm first identifies equations with a single
variable in each, and variables occurring in a single equation each, and
then uses a combination of column and row approximate minimum degree
permutations (\texttt{colamd}) followed by a Dulmage-Mendelsohn
permutation (\texttt{dmperm}).

The output arguments \texttt{NameBlk} and \texttt{EqtnBlk} are 1-by-N
cell arrays, where N is the number of blocks, and each cell is a 1-by-Kn
cell array of strings, where Kn is the number of variables and equations
in block N.
