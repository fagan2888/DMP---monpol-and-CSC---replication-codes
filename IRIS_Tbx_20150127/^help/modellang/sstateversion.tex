	\paragraph{Syntax}

\begin{verbatim}
FullEquation !! SteadyStateEquation;
\end{verbatim}

\paragraph{Description}

For each transition or measurement equation, you can provide a separate
steady-state version of it. The steady-state version is used when you
run the functions \href{model/sstate}{\texttt{sstate}} and
\href{model/chksstate}{\texttt{chksstate}}, the latter unless you change
the option \texttt{'eqtn='}. This is useful when you can substantially
simplify some parts of the full dynamic equations, and help therefore
the numerical solver to achieve faster and possibly laso more accurate
results.

Why is a double exclamation point, \texttt{!!}, used to start the
steady-state versions of equations? Because if you associate your model
file extension(s) (such as \texttt{'mod'} or \texttt{'model'}) with the
Matlab editor, anything after an exclamation point is displayed red
making it easier to spot the steady-state equations.

\paragraph{Example}

The following steady state version will be, of course, valid only in
stationary models where we can safely remove lags and leads.

\begin{verbatim}
Lambda = Lambda{1}*(1+r)*beta !! r = 1/beta - 1;
\end{verbatim}

\paragraph{Example}

\begin{verbatim}
log(A) = log(A{-1}) + epsilon_a !! A = 1;
\end{verbatim}
