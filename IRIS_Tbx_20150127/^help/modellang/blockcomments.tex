	\paragraph{Syntax}

\begin{verbatim}
%{ Anything between
the opening block comment sign
and the closing block comment sign
is discarded %}
\end{verbatim}

\paragraph{Description}

Unlike in Matlab, the opening and closing block comment signs do not
need to stand alone on otherwise blank lines. You can even have block
comments contained withing a single line.

\paragraph{Example}

\begin{verbatim}
!transition_equations
    x = rho*x{-1} %{ this is a valid block comment %} + epsilon;
\end{verbatim}
