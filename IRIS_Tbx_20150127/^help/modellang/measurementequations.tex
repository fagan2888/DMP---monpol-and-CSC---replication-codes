	\paragraph{Syntax}

\begin{verbatim}
!measurement_equations
    Equation1;
    Equation2;
    Equation3;
    ...
\end{verbatim}

\paragraph{Syntax with equation
labels}

\begin{verbatim}
!measurement_equations
    Equation1;
    'Equation label' Equation2;
    Equation3;
    ...
\end{verbatim}

\paragraph{Description}

The \texttt{!measurement\_equations} keyword starts a new block of
measurement equations; the equations can stretch over multiple lines and
must be separated by semi-colons. You can have as many equation blocks
as you wish in any order in your model file: They all get combined
together when you read the model file in.

You can add descriptive labels to the equations (in single or double
quotes, preceding the equation); these will be stored in, and accessible
from, the model object.

\paragraph{Example}

\begin{verbatim}
!measurement_equations
    'Inflation observations' Infl = 40*(P/P{-1} - 1);
\end{verbatim}
