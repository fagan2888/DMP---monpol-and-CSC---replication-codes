% Description
% ============
%
% Equations that have the equal sign marked with an `#` can be simulated in
% an exact non-linear mode.
%
% Why is it the channels sign, `#`, that is used to mark the equations for
% exact non-linear simulations? Because if you associate your model file
% extension with the Matlab editor, the channel signs are displayed red
% making it easier to spot them.
